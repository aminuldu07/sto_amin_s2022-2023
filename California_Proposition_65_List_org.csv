SAFE DRINKING WATER AND TOXIC ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1986,,,
CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE TO CAUSE CANCER OR REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY,,,
"August 11, 2023",,,
The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 requires that the Governor revise and,,,
republish at least once per year the list of chemicals known to the State to cause cancer or,,,
reproductive toxicity. The identification number indicated in the following list is the Chemical Abstracts,,,
Service (CAS) Registry Number. No CAS number is given when several substances are presented as,,,
a single listing. The date refers to the initial appearance of the chemical on the list. For easy,,,
"reference, chemicals which are shown underlined are newly added. Chemicals or endpoints shown in",,,
"strikeout were placed on the Proposition 65 list on the date noted, and have subsequently been",,,
removed.,,,
